Business Case + draft Plan
Objective
You are to prepare a business case for your project:
 a short written document describing WHAT your project is about(Introduction/Definition/Vision), WHY(Motivation/Application/Market) it is important and worth doing,
and identifying the GOALS(Scope/Goal) that your project aims to achieve in order
to be a success.
a draft plan of the 1st iteration: a short document describing the first
goal or milestone(Milestone One) you intend to complete by end of week 6. Your plan
should include a baseline SCHEDULE(Gantt Chart) identifying the tasks you need
to undertake. It should also briefly describe your team organization(Role & Responsibility/Communication),

Deliverables
You will submit a 4 page PDF format document through Canvas. The document
should have two parts as described below, each part taking approximately
2 pages. The deadline is Monday of week 5.

Part1 Business Case
Similar to the pitch presentation, the most important thing here is to introduce
your project to the reader. You should aim for a concise, clear and
accessible (easy to . understand) presentation: you should not go into excessive
detail (several of the other assessed activities will provide scope for
detail). Make sure you include an executive SUMMARY as your first paragraph.

A DIAGRAM may be helpful, but you must stay within the two page
limit. Stay focused on the criteria (WHAT, WHY and GOALS) described in
the objective: 
WHAT problem will your project solve,
WHY does that problem need to be solved 
HOW will you know that you have solved it?

The deadline for this assignment is after you present your oral pitch.
Therefore, you have the opportunity to edit your business case or address
any questions or problems that arose during your pitch.

Part2 Draft Plan
Each team should write a iteration1 plan: a short document describing your
MILESTONE 1 and the SCHEDULE your team intend to follow in
order to get complete the iteration by the end of week6.
Your plan should break down the work into a LIST of well-defined activities and
make use of a GANTT CHART to illustrate the schedule, which will serve as a reference point to measure team progress.
You will (of course) need to think about how TEAM organization is
working, describe current ROLES and RESPONSIBILITIES and 
have a COMMUNICATION PLAN in place, both internally INTERNALLY the group and EXTERNALLY to stakeholders, to support the rest of your project.

###############################################################################

Ethics
The GOALS are CRITICAL; choose them wisely and make sure they are ACHIEVABLE.
If a few of the GOALS are AMBITIOUS and you are not sure whether they are achievable, make that clear.

Your PLAN should describe what you are ACTUALLY going to do, not just
be something that looks good on paper! You can end up in a terrible mess
trying to explain why something has gone wrong when planned activities
would have prevented it.

As the team is likely to meet your supervisor during week4, they should
PREPARE and SEND a PDF format draft of the 2-part document to him/her at
least a day before this meeting, so that he/she can provide the team with
FEEDBACK.

Assessment
This document is worth 5% of the marks for the course. 65% of those marks
will be awarded for content (i.e. the extent to which you addressed the
objectives. The remaining 35% of the marks for this assessment activity will
be for presentation style, including how effective you are at communicating
in written form and using diagrams.

Content:
Have you said WHAT your project is? Have you said WHY it is important?

Is there ENOUGH context given for the audience to understand the
PROBLEM being addressed?

Is there ENOUGH context give an audience an intuitive understanding
of your SOLUTION/GOALS?

Is the content ACCURATE?

Is your solution FEASIBLE? Can it be DONE in one semester?

If your project can be EXTENDED have you defined how it can be extended?

Does your draft plan have a MILESTONE 1 clearly described in the
text?

Does your plan have a SCHEDULE - in the form of a GANTT CHART chart that
clearly defines your list of activities and dependencies.

Does your schedule clearly RELATE to your first milestone?
It your TEAM organization succinctly described?

Do your team have a COMMUNICATION plan in place?

Are all the non-obvious assertions that you make backed up with REFERENCES,
or illustrative EXAMPLES?



Style:
Does your document adhere to the PAGE limit (you risk losing marks
if it doesn’t).

Is the language DIRECT and ACCESSIBLE. Does it make use of the reader’s
experience or prior knowledge.

Do you define the PROBLEM you want to solve near the start of the
talk?

Do you, at some stage, clearly define how your SOLUTION solves the
problem? Do you clearly define the BENEFIT?

Do you have a short and clear THEME that you introduce early and
recapitulate toward the end. It is really GOOD if you can capture the
ESSENCE of your product in a SENTENCE.

Is your document clearly STRUCTURED. Does the reader know where
they are and where they are going?

Are your sentences structured to be as SHORT, DIRECT and MEANINGFUL
as they can be?1

Does your document have a NARRATIVE FLOW? Does each part follow on
from the other? A first draft rarely has good narrative flow but this
can be fixed as the document is refined.

Do you use active rather than passive voice in your writing? For this
type of presentation the ACTIVE voice is better because it is more DIRECT.

Are you careful with your use of the word “THIS”. The word “this” is
a pointer to a previously defined object and is often ambiguous. It is
very often better to name the object directly than to use “this”.

Are the TECHNICAL explanations easy enough for someone not familiar
with this work to follow?

Use PRONOUN. Short sentences can be taken too far. If you find you have lots of sentences containing
references to the same object e.g. ‘The YYYY” then your sentences may be too short.
